We can use one of the following chains to retrieve answers from the desired document:

1. **QA Chain**
2. **Conversational Chain**

Each has its own pros and cons:

---

### 1. **QA Chain**

**Pros**:

- Fast and efficient, as it does **not send the entire chat history** to the LLM.
- Focuses only on the **current query** and its relevant context, which reduces token usage and improves performance.

**Cons**:

- Lacks **conversation memory**, so it does not understand follow-up questions or references to earlier parts of the conversation.
- Less suited for **multi-turn interactions** where context needs to be preserved.

---

### 2. **Conversational Chain**

**Pros**:

- Maintains **conversation history**, enabling a more natural and coherent dialogue across multiple turns.
- Ideal for follow-up questions, clarifications, and context-aware answers.

**Cons**:

- Slightly **slower and more expensive**, as the entire chat history (or a portion of it) is passed to the LLM in every turn.
- Can hit **token limits** faster in longer conversations.

### **`ConversationalRetrievalChain` Workflow**  

#### **1. Document Ingestion & Preprocessing**  
   - **Input Formats**: Support PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML, etc.  
   - **Extraction**: Use libraries like `PyPDF2`, `docx2txt`, or `UnstructuredIO` for accurate text extraction.  
   - **Cleanup**: Remove headers/footers, irrelevant formatting, and OCR errors (if scanned).  

#### **2. Text Consolidation & Chunking**  
   - **Merge Content**: Combine pages/sections logically (e.g., by topic if multi-doc).  
   - **Chunking Strategy**:  
     - Use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` (LangChain) for semantic coherence.  
     - Optimal chunk size (~512-1024 tokens) based on embedding model (e.g., OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small`).  
     - Overlap (~10-20%) to preserve context across chunks.  

#### **3. Embedding & Vector Storage**  
   - **Embedding Model**:  
     - Options: OpenAI, `sentence-transformers` (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`), or Cohere.  
     - Cache embeddings to avoid reprocessing.  
   - **Vector Database**:  
     - Popular choices: FAISS (local), Pinecone/Weaviate (cloud), or Chroma (lightweight).  
     - Index embeddings with metadata (e.g., source document, page number).  

#### **4. Conversation Memory**  
   - **Memory Type**:  
     - `ConversationBufferMemory` for short chats.  
     - `ConversationSummaryMemory` for longer histories (reduces token usage).  
   - **Key Setup**: Include `memory_key="chat_history"` in the chain.  

#### **5. LLM Integration**  
   - **Model Selection**:  
     - GPT-3.5/4, Claude, or open-source (e.g., Llama 3 via `Ollama`).  
     - Configure temperature/max_tokens for response control.  

#### **6. Chain Assembly**  
   ```python
   from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain

   chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
       llm=llm_model,
       retriever=vector_db.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3}),  # Top 3 relevant chunks
       memory=memory_buffer,
       chain_type="stuff",  # Or "map_reduce" for larger docs
       verbose=True  # Debugging
   )
   ```

#### **7. Query Handling**  
   - **User Input**: Accept queries with optional context (e.g., "Based on Doc X, explain...").  
   - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:  
     - Retrieve relevant chunks → Inject into LLM prompt.  
     - Filter low-relevance results (cosine similarity threshold).  

#### **8. Output & Post-Processing**  
   - **Response**: LLM generates answers grounded in retrieved docs.  
   - **Citations**: Attach source references (e.g., "Page 12 of Doc Y").  
   - **Fallback**: Handle "I don’t know" cases gracefully.
